 * Conditional Statements
 *
 * You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.
 * In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
 * Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
 * Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
 * Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
 * Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
